`alfred-workflow-tools` is a collection of Go tools that should be invoked by [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) in [a workflow](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/).

The results are returned using the [Alfred Script Filter JSON Format](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/inputs/script-filter/json/) so they can automatically be consumed by a workflow.

## Twitch

`cmd/twitch` fetches Follows (or only Live Follows) for a specific [Twitch](https://twitch.tv) User or a list of Live Streams for a specific Game (and optionally in a specific Language).

### Usage

`cmd/twitch` can be executed in a [Run Script Action](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/actions/run-script/) to return Twitch Follows:

```shell
$ twitch
{
  "items": [
    {
      "title": "Streamer 1",
      "subtitle": "Science & Technology - 8625 viewers - Coding things",
      "arg": "https://www.twitch.tv/streamer1"
    },
    {

      "subtitle": "Just Chatting - 2811 viewers - Chatting about things",
      "arg": "https://www.twitch.tv/streamer2"
    },
    â€¦
  ]
}
```

You can also use the `--live` option to only return Twitch Follows that are currently live or alternatively the `--game` option to only return Twitch Live Streams for a specific Game ID (and optionally in a specific Language by using the `--gameLang` option with an ISO 639-1 two-letter language code).
